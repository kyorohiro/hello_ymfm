# Save Point

Last updated: 2026-08-14

## Current status

- `docs/beep.html`
  YM2612 beep demo works in the browser.
- `docs/psg.html`
  Sega PSG demo works in the browser.
- `docs/vgm.html`
  VGM file can be parsed and played with YM2612 + PSG.
- `docs/ym2612vgm.js`
  Minimal VGM support was expanded to reduce `SKIP`.

## VGM support added today

- YM2612 register write
  - `0x52`
  - `0x53`
- PSG write
  - `0x50`
- Wait / end
  - `0x61`
  - `0x62`
  - `0x63`
  - `0x66`
  - `0x70-0x7f`
- YM2612 DAC / stream related
  - `0x67` data block: store block data
  - `0x80-0x8f`: DAC write + wait
  - `0x90-0x95`: minimal DAC stream handling
  - `0xe0`: data bank seek

## What changed

- `docs/ym2612vgm.js`
  Added data block loading, YM2612 DAC handling, and minimal DAC stream playback.
- `web/ym2612vgm.js`
  Synced with `docs/ym2612vgm.js`.
- `docs/vgm.html`
  Wait rendering was split so DAC stream writes can happen during playback timing.

## What we observed

- The second VGM plays without `SKIP`.
- The first VGM also has no `SKIP` now, but sound starts after a long delay.
- That likely means:
  - the song has a long silent intro, or
  - the interesting part starts later, or
  - the track structure depends on data that is not ideal for this minimal player yet.

## Important interpretation

- "No sound at first" is not automatically a parser bug now.
- If there is no `SKIP`, the next thing to inspect is the VGM content itself:
  - long wait before first key-on
  - long wait before audible FM/PSG part
  - DAC-heavy intro

## Still not fully supported

- `0x68` PCM RAM write is still skipped.
- Special / uncommon `0x67` block types are still skipped.
- DAC stream handling is minimal.
- Real hardware accuracy is not the goal yet.

## Scope risk

- Building a serious "full VGM player" could easily consume 2-4 months.
- The expensive part is not only implementation.
- It also includes:
  - command coverage
  - DAC / PCM correctness
  - testing assets
  - result verification
  - compatibility differences between VGM files

## Practical scope for this repository

- This repository does not need to become a complete VGM player first.
- A more realistic target is:
  - a YM2612 + PSG learning-oriented VGM player
  - browser / WASM playback
  - support for a practical subset of Genesis / DefleMask-oriented VGM data
  - clear documentation about what is supported and what is not

## Important reminder

- "Achieve this repository's goals" is not the same as "support all VGM files".
- Avoid accidentally turning this repository into a full compatibility project too early.

## Genesis-oriented work list

- Phase 1: keep the current base stable
  - keep `docs/beep.html` working
  - keep `docs/psg.html` working
  - keep `docs/vgm.html` working for the current sample VGMs
- Phase 2: clarify the Genesis audio model in docs
  - explain that Mega Drive / Genesis audio is mainly `YM2612 + PSG`
  - explain which part is FM and which part is PSG
  - explain where DAC / PCM belongs in YM2612
- Phase 3: strengthen VGM parsing for Genesis use
  - confirm handling for `0x50`
  - confirm handling for `0x52` / `0x53`
  - confirm handling for waits and loop-related behavior
  - document which DAC / PCM commands are supported now
  - inspect whether `0x68` matters for target Genesis VGM files
- Phase 4: prepare small test assets
  - one short FM-only Genesis VGM
  - one short PSG-including Genesis VGM
  - one short DAC / PCM-including Genesis VGM
  - keep them short enough for easy debugging
- Phase 5: improve debug visibility
  - show accumulated VGM time while parsing
  - show first YM2612 key-on timing
  - show first PSG write timing
  - show first DAC activity timing
  - show unsupported commands clearly
- Phase 6: define the practical compatibility target
  - write "supported Genesis VGM subset"
  - write "known unsupported patterns"
  - avoid claiming full VGM compatibility
- Phase 7: browser embedding path
  - keep the WASM build instructions simple
  - keep the JavaScript API simple
  - show the minimum code needed to connect to Web Audio
  - keep the demo pages as small reference implementations
- Phase 8: learning examples
  - add an example for YM2612 FM note playback
  - add an example for PSG tone playback
  - add an example for YM2612 DAC playback
  - add an example for mixed YM2612 + PSG playback
- Phase 9: optional later work
  - add better loop handling
  - add stricter DAC stream behavior
  - add more Genesis-focused VGM compatibility
  - consider DefleMask-oriented workflow notes

## Priority view

### Must

- keep `docs/beep.html`, `docs/psg.html`, and `docs/vgm.html` working
- document the Genesis audio model as `YM2612 + PSG`
- keep YM2612 / PSG / basic VGM playback understandable
- clarify the current supported VGM subset
- prepare short Genesis-focused VGM test assets
- keep the WASM + JavaScript browser path simple and reproducible
- add learning examples for:
  - YM2612 FM
  - PSG tone
  - YM2612 DAC
  - mixed YM2612 + PSG

### Nice to have

- improve debug visibility in `docs/vgm.html`
- show first key-on / first PSG / first DAC timing
- add better loop handling
- add clearer DefleMask-oriented workflow notes
- support more Genesis VGM command patterns as needed by real samples
- treat VGM DAC stream control `0x90-0x95` as a future compatibility target unless target Genesis / DefleMask files require it

### Not now

- full VGM compatibility
- real hardware accuracy tuning
- broad support for many non-Genesis chip targets
- turning this repository into a general-purpose VGM player project

## Current decision about `0x90-0x95`

- `0x90-0x95` DAC stream control is postponed for now.
- Reason:
  - it is part of broader VGM compatibility work
  - it can easily expand the scope too much
  - it should only be prioritized if target Genesis / DefleMask VGM files actually require it
- Important distinction:
  - YM2612 register writes such as `register=0x94` are normal FM register writes
  - that is different from VGM command `0x94`

## Good next steps

1. In `docs/vgm.html`, show more timing information:
   - total wait before first audible section
   - first key-on timing
   - first YM2612 DAC activity timing
2. Add a simple debug view:
   - command index
   - accumulated VGM samples
   - accumulated seconds
3. If the first VGM still feels suspicious, inspect which command appears just before the first audible sound.
4. Only after that, decide whether `0x68` or stricter DAC stream behavior is worth implementing.

## Files to reopen next time

- `docs/vgm.html`
- `docs/ym2612vgm.js`
- `web/ym2612vgm.js`

## Short reminder for future me

- The project is already past the "can browser/WASM make sound?" phase.
- The next work is mostly about VGM behavior, timing visibility, and incremental compatibility.
- Do not overreact to silence if `SKIP` is already gone.
